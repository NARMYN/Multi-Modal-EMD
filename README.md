# Multi-Modal-EMD

This repository contains implementation of wasserstein distance on embeddings based multi-modal data of cancer subtypes 

## Introduction

**This research work implements the integrative approach suggested in the paper '[aWCluster: A Novel Integrative Network-Based Clustering of Multiomics for Subtype Analysis of Cancer Data](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TCBB.2020.3039511)' for multi-omics on the multi-modal data of four different modalities and five cancer subtypes**

| ESCA | 184 |
| CESC | 294 |
| BLCA | 406 |
| LUSC | 490 |
